# Prosper_IT_Code_Summaries

This repository contains detailed summaries of work I performed for Prosper I.T. Consulting over the course of four Agile sprints. Collaborating with other developers over Azure DevOps and Slack, I help to design two sets of web application.  Working in C#/ASP.NET I contributed to two company portal websites designed to manage employees, job/duty information, shifts, and other company functions. Using Python/Django, the team and I created two web apps to serve as a hub for relevant information datascraped from across the web.
